# For servers listening on same host:port
#- The first server for a unique host:port combination that you 
# define in your configuration file will be the default server 
# for all requests arriving on that specific host:port pair, 
# unless those requests have a Host header that explicitly matches 
# another server_name configured for that same host:port."

# logic process decision for which block would process the request. (for servers listening on same host:port)
#- if there is a server_name then that one has precedence.
#- otherwise, check if a block matches the URI in location or root.
#- if none, it falls directly in the default server block.
